Since we aren't be in the same place for your birthday this year, I thought it would be fun to make you a virtual letter. 

As you know, I'm pretty bad about taking photos and stuff, but these are some of my favorites that I could track down. I hope they all bring back some good memories. If you click on them you can scroll down and see which ones are grouped together and some captions I've added. 

I hope you have an amazing 21st birthday and 21st year! You are a really kind and thoughtful person and I am so grateful for you. I can't wait to celebrate even more when you get back.

Love Bennett
